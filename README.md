# DotAQuiz
A discord bot made with python, discord.py

This is a project I started in 2020 May to learn more about python, so it's probably not the best in terms of efficiency.
All of the images I use in the bot are from DotA2, the bot has commands such as quiz, blitz, shopquiz and endless which
allow users to make money which they can spend on the store commands, items they can purchase enhance how they get to use
the quiz commands mentioned above.

# Issues
There are many issues, mostly OOP related ones:
I can't sort the help command, optimally, it would be as such:
Quizes:
  quiz
  blitz
  shopquiz
  endless
Store:
  store
  buy
  sell
  gold
  inventory
Miscallenous:
  oversight
  hohoohahaa
  newpatch
...
Store and Miscallenous commands being sorted don't have much of an impact but the "Quizes" cog should be sorted.
